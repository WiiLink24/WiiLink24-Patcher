# WiiLink Patcher (.NET Version)

WiiLink Patcher is a program made for easier installation of WiiLink. With it, you can just sit back and relax while the patcher does everything for you.

It utilizes [libWiiSharp](https://github.com/WiiDatabase/libWiiSharp) to download channel contents, and patches them with [VCDiff](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/vcdiff), to create the patched WADs that you can install on your Wii, and use with WiiLink24!
